# Vagrantfile to setup a Kubernetes Cluster on Oracle Linux 7
This Vagrantfile will provision a Kubernetes cluster with one master and _n_
worker nodes (2 by default).

## Prerequisites
1. Install [Oracle VM VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
1. Install [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com/)

## Quick start
1. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/oracle/vagrant-boxes`
1. Change into the `vagrant-boxes/Kubernetes` folder
1. Run `vagrant up`

Your cluster is ready!  
Within the master guest (`vagrant ssh master`) you can check the status of the
cluster (as the `vagrant` user). E.g.:
- `kubectl cluster-info`
- `kubectl get nodes`
- `kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system`

## If your Container Registry requires authentication
_Note_: as of October 2019, the Oracle Container Registry does no longer
require authentication for open source projects. Use these instructions if
you mirror the container images on a registry requiring authentication.

1. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/oracle/vagrant-boxes`
1. Change into the `vagrant-boxes/Kubernetes` folder
1. Run `vagrant up master; vagrant ssh master`
1. Within the master guest, run as `root`:  
`/vagrant/scripts/kubeadm-setup-master.sh`  
You will be asked to log in to the Oracle Container Registry
1. Run `vagrant up worker1; vagrant ssh worker1`
1. Within the worker1 guest, run as `root`:  
`/vagrant/scripts/kubeadm-setup-worker.sh`  
You will be asked to log in to the Oracle Container Registry
1. Repeat the last 2 steps for worker2

## About the Vagrantfile

The VMs communicate via a private network:

- Master node: 192.168.99.100 / master.vagrant.vm
- Worker node i: 192.168.99.(100+i) / worker_i_.vagrant.vm

The Vagrant provisioning script pre-loads Kubernetes and satisfies the
pre-requisites.
Unless you have a password-less [Local Registry](#local-registry) it does
**not** run `kubeadm-setup.sh` as this requires authentication to the
[Oracle Container Registry](https://container-registry.oracle.com). This is
done by the `kubeadm-setup-master.sh` and `kubeadm-setup-worker.sh` helper
scripts.

## Configuration
The Vagrantfile can be used _as-is_; there are a couple of parameters you
can set to tailor the installation to your needs.

### How to configure
There are several ways to set parameters:
1. Update the Vagrantfile. This is straightforward; the downside is that you
will loose changes when you update this repository.
1. Use environment variables. Might be difficult to remember the parameters
used when the box was instantiated.
1. Use the `.env`/`.env.local` files (requires
[vagrant-env](https://github.com/gosuri/vagrant-env) plugin). Configure
your cluster by editing the `.env` file; or better copy `.env` to `.env.local`
and edit the latter one, it won't be overridden when you update this repository
and it won't mark your git tree as changed (you won't accidentally commit your
local configuration!)

Parameters are considered in the following order (first one wins):
1. Environment variables
1. `.env.local` (if [vagrant-env](https://github.com/gosuri/vagrant-env) plugin
is installed)
1. `.env` (if [vagrant-env](https://github.com/gosuri/vagrant-env) plugin
is installed)
1. Vagrantfile definitions

### Cluster parameters
- `NB_WORKERS` (default: 2): the number of worker nodes to provision.
- Yum channel parameters. The following 2 parameters can be used to enable the
_Preview_ and/or _Developer_ channels. These channels are disabled by default
to install the latest supported version of the Docker Engine and Kubernetes.
  - `USE_PREVIEW` (default: `false`): when `true`, Vagrant provisioning script
will enable the _Oracle Linux 7 Preview_ channel.  
  - `USE_DEV` (default: `false`): when `true`, Vagrant provisioning script
will enable the _Oracle Linux 7 Developer_ channel.  
See also [Installing the Developer release of Kubernetes](#installing-the-developer-release-of-kubernetes).
- `MANAGE_FROM_HOST` (default: `false`): when `true`, Vagrant will bind port
`6443` from the master node to the host.
This allows you to manage the cluster from the host itself using the generated
`admin.conf` file (assuming `kubectl` is installed on the host).
- `BIND_PROXY` (default: `true`): when `true`, Vagrant will bind the Kubernetes
Proxy port from the master node to the host. Useful to access the
Dashboard or any other application from _outside_ the cluster.
It is an easier alternative to ssh tunnel.
- `MEMORY` (default: 2048): all VMs are provisioned with 2GB memory. This
can be slightly reduced if memory is a concern.

### Registry Mirror
If you are using an [Oracle Container Registry Mirror](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E52668_01/E88884/html/requirements-registry-mirror.html)
you can use the following two parameters:
- `KUBE_REPO`: registry hostname
- `KUBE_PREFIX`: image prefix for Kubernetes container images

__Example__: to use the Oracle Container Registry mirror in Frankfurt, define
```ruby
KUBE_REPO = "container-registry-fra.oracle.com"
KUBE_PREFIX = "/kubernetes"
```

### Local Registry
You can also setup a [Local Registry](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E52668_01/E88884/html/requirements-registry-local.html).
In addition to the `KUBE_REPO` and `KUBE_PREFIX` parameters you can also define:
- `KUBE_LOGIN` (default: `undefined`/`true`): set to `false` if your registry
does not require authentication.
- `KUBE_SSL` (default: `undefined`/`true`): set to `false` if your registry
does not use SSL.

__Example__: you have a local repository on host.example.com, without authentication and SSL is not configured; this registry has been populated with:
```shell
kubeadm-registry.sh --to host.example.com:5000/kubernetes --version 1.9.1
```
You will then define in tour Vagrantfile:
```ruby
KUBE_REPO = "host.example.com:5000"
KUBE_PREFIX = "/kubernetes"
KUBE_LOGIN = false
KUBE_SSL = false
```

__Note__: if you have a password-less registry (`KUBE_LOGIN = false`) the
Vagrant provisioning script will also run the `kubeadm-setup-master.sh` / `kubeadm-setup-worker.sh` scripts. In other words, your Kubernetes
cluster will be fully operational after a `vagrant up`!

See also the [Container Registry Vagrantfile](../ContainerRegistry) to run a
local registry in Vagrant.

### Installing the Developer release of Kubernetes
To install the latest Developer release of Kubernetes you need to enable
the _Developer_ channel __and__ amend the `KUBE_PREFIX`:
```ruby
USE_DEV = true
KUBE_PREFIX = "/kubernetes_developer"
```

## Optional plugins
You might want to install the following Vagrant plugins:
- [vagrant-env](https://github.com/gosuri/vagrant-env): loads environment
variables from .env files;
- [vagrant-hosts](https://github.com/oscar-stack/vagrant-hosts): maintains
/etc/hosts for the guest VMs;
- [vagrant-proxyconf](https://github.com/tmatilai/vagrant-proxyconf): set
proxies in the guest VMs if you need to access Internet through proxy. See
plugin documentation for the configuration.
